SIFT (MATLAB)
====
Scale-invariant feature transform (or SIFT) is an algorithm to detect and describe local features in images. it is a method extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene.<br\>

Input images and Output images (after SIFT is applied) are inlucded with the code.
